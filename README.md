# Cryptocurrencies

## OVERVIEW

### A prominent investment bank is interested in offering a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for its customers. This analysis will look at what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for a new investment. 

### The data provided is not ideal and has no known output, it will need to be processed to fit the machine learning models. Unsupervised learning will be used. 
### The data will be preprocessed for PCA and data dimensions will be reduced using PCA.  to group the cryptocurrencies, a clustering algorithm (K-means) will be utilized. Data visualizations from the analysis will be used to share the findings.
